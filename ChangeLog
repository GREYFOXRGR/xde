    * Changed shadow memory implementation from linear to sparse. Non-contiguous
      memory ranges can now be handled more efficiently.
    * Add edge attributes in CFG for conditional jump instructions. Edge
      attribute is named "predicate" and is set to `True', for the CFG edge
      followed when the condition evaluates to true, and `False' for the other
      edge.
    * Fixed Sphinx header typo.
    * Convert "0x%x" to "%#x" in calls to `print'.

    * Completely re-wrote and re-designed XDE to make it able to perform large
      scale analyses with the help of `pyrsistence' (tagged as v2.0).

    * Added class `XRefs'; a container for an instruction's code and data
      cross references.
    * Replaced all calls to `get_xxx_target_addresses()' with `get_xrefs()', a
      generic function returning an `XRefs' instance.
    * Modified class `BasicBlock'. It's now easier to determine exact basic
      block boundaries.
    * Several improvements in disassembly and function detection logic.
    * Added method `get_function_basic_blocks()' in class `Disassembler'.
    * Added "TODO" file and sample codes in "examples/".
