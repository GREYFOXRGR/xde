    * Design a simple HEADs API just like the one offered by IDAPython.
    * CPU module should be able to hold current register state. API for getting
      and setting registers?
    * Mark headers and metadata as M_DATA. We need a good abstract binary
      framework to do this correctly.
    * Augment disassembly by analyzing DWARF for ELF and Mach-O and PDB for PE.
    * Take into account LC_FUNCTION_STARTS load command for Mach-O.
